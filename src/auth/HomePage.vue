    <h2 class="title has-text-centered">🚨 THE PROBLEM: <br/> Why Farmers Struggle with Greenhouse</h2>
    <p class="content mx-4">
      🔴 <b>Traditional greenhouses are too expensive!</b> Steel poles,
        UV poly, and imported components drive costs too high. <br/>
      🔴 <b>High upfront investment stops adoption.</b>
        Farmers can’t risk big money without guaranteed returns. <br/>
      🔴 <b>Bangladesh’s extreme weather makes structures vulnerable.</b>
        Heatwaves, floods, and storms can destroy traditional greenhouses. <br/>
      🔴 <b>Lack of localized solutions.</b> Available greenhouse models are
        built for other climates, not optimized for our sub-tropical conditions. <br/>

    <p class="content">
      🔹 MVP Development (March 2024 - June 2024): <br/>
      We are now building and testing the first prototype on a pilot farm to validate: <br/>
      ✔ Structural durability <br/>
      ✔ Crop yield performance (Starting with tomatoes 🍅) <br/>
      ✔ Cost vs. ROI <br/>
    </p>
  </div>
</section>


🔮 Future Vision: Scaling Open-Source Farming<br/>
Once we prove the MVP, we will:<br/>
✅ Open-source all designs, making them accessible to all farmers.<br/>
✅ Crowdfund & partner with NGOs to bring this innovation to more farmers.<br/>
✅ Train & support early adopters to build their own greenhouse. <br/>

💡 This isn’t just a greenhouse—it’s a revolution in modern, sustainable farming!<br/>
